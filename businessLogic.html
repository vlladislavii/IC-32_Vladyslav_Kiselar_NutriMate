        <h3>General Description:</h3>
        <p>This web application was made by Kiselar Vladyslav. Using a free calorie calculator, you can create a menu of a certain calorie content or calculate the energy value of your breakfast, lunch and dinner. The calculator is a food database and works like a street coffee machine: you simply select the desired product or ready-made dish, indicate its weight and add it to your menu. As such, there is no single and generally accepted daily calorie intake. According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, “the energy entering the body (in calories) must be balanced with the energy expended.” Thus, your individual calorie intake depends, first of all, on the nature of your work, level of physical activity, gender, age and a number of other factors. However, on the Internet you can find many tables and calculators of unknown origin, offering information on daily values, supposedly based on authoritative sources. We believe that the quality of this information is quite questionable.</p>
